# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for flight delays utilizing a dataset spanning from 2018 to 2023. Leveraging various pre-processing techniques, we explore methods to enhance the quality and relevance of the data. Subsequently, we apply four distinct machine learning algorithms to analyze the processed datasets. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of each method in accurately predicting flight delays, thereby contributing to the advancement of predictive analytics in the aviation industry. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis, we seek to identify the most effective approach for predicting flight delays, offering valuable insights for stakeholders to optimize operational efficiency and enhance passenger experience.

# Test the code
